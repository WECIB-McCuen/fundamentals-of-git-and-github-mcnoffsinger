##What I learned

A lot of stuff. I already knew how to clone, add, commit, and push, but this was a helpful review of those too. I learned what git fetch and git pull were, and the difference between them. I also learned what a pull request is.

git fetch - downloads the latest changes from the remote repository to your local repository without merging them automatically.

git pull - git fetch and git merge in one command. Downloads the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local branch.

pull request - basically a request to merge your local branch with the remote repository, or main branch. Usually only used ina team setting where you might have to ask a "repo maintainer" befor eyou push. The request allows time for discussion and solving merge conflicts with the whole team.
